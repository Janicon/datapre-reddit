        "I had a rough childhood, and my mom really tried to make things better by getting involved in my interests. My estranged brother's abandoned PS with a brand new copy of FFVII turned into liking anime, Golgo 13, a Wind Named Amnesia, Vulcan Wars, and by my early teenage years my mom was driving me weekly to the local college campus for anime club (they screened R-rated and obviously couldn't let a 13 year old in without parental permission) where fan subs, and just good old official releases were screened. Cowboy Bebop, Spriggan, Wings of Honneamise, Perfect Blue, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, the Patlabor movies. Sure there were always the silly things (\"I Want to be your Angel\" was my favorite) but even with things like Trigun and Evangelion the dopey ecchi stuff was directly tied into the story in a real way.\n\nIt feels like the last anime I watched that didn't have some 13 year-old kid trip and fall into someone's J sized breasts and wasn't AoT was Black Lagoon. I guess Gangsta is around now but it just sucks. Salaryman Club I enjoy.\n\nEven the good stuff, Spy x Family, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, can't not have stupid ecchi crap in it.\n\nI used to love anime because it did sci-fi and fantasy so much better than live-action could do. And while there was always infantile stuff there seemed to be a real place for serious thoughtful story-telling. Now it just seems like even serious stories have to have massive breasts, sauna scenes where some dude gets a peak and has an exaggerated nosebleed, and those dopey cartoon faces with giant teardrops. I'm not saying there aren't serious animes, obviously AoT is a great example, but it seems like even the good ones have *some* ecchi crap in it (I know I mentioned Cowboy Bebop, but even Faye's fan-service was a genuine commentary on the femme fatale trope and Spike never got a nosebleed when he tripped and accidentally grabbed her boob then fell deeply in love with her), and purely serious ones are nearly extinct.\n\nAm I just being a fogey? Was I maybe just exposed to the good stuff out of luck? Or has anime just changed?",

If you want to talk about the games, please do this in a way that doesn't spoil it for people who might pick them up because of the anime. That being said, small, inconsequential stuff is *probably* fine, like [Mask of Deception]&gt;!how in one episode, Atuy says \"Time for war!\", one of her battle lines in the games!&lt;.

The Season 1 summaries on the information pages are safe, but it's not hard to run into spoiler information even through something as innocuous as looking at cast lists - gods help you if you go on the Fandom Wikia.  **UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES GO LOOKING AT EVEN OFFICIAL INFO FOR KAI OR LATER AHEAD OF TIME.** (The official image for Rei is 100% a spoiler, for example.)  **Also, do NOT look at any Kitsu page after the first season; Kai's description on Kitsu is in fact a major spoiler.**  Like, really, just stay out of anything that isn't a basic Season 1 summary until you're done.  It's much safer that way.\n\n2) **Also, be wary of potentially running into spoilers on the r/anime front page on June 19 or thereabouts this year**; there is suspicion that some sort of new Higurashi anime project will be announced on that date (this year is the 20th anniversary of the release of the original Onikakushi-hen VN - hence why I am running this rewatch this year! - and multiple official accounts have teased an announcement on that date), and you could run into spoilers that way.  (Those of you who remember the Madoka rewatch last year will recognize the issue, though admittedly I expect Sotsu was enough of a disappointment to significantly reduce the risk - at least relative to the potential that was in fact realized with the Walpurgis no Kaiten announcment.)\n\n##**A Reminder to Rewatchers**  \n\nPlease do not spoil the experience for first-timers; this is a mystery after all.  In particular, ~~Shion is a spoiler until Episode 5~~ and [Higurashi] &gt;!Hanyuu is a spoiler until Minagoroshi-hen.  Also, the glorious nipah is indeed glorious but Rika does not use it until Himatsubushi-hen.!&lt;  Please keep these in mind!  \n\n\n##**A Reminder to Rewatchers, Reiterated**  \n\nSince ***somebody*** forgot that something was a spoiler last time and inadvertently spoiled a first-timer in the process: *Please do not spoil the experience for first-timers; this is a mystery after all.*  Consider whether what you are saying has actually been revealed yet on-screen before you post!\n\n##**(Time for) Club Activities!**\n\n(Alexa play \"Shoubu!\"!  Except do **NOT** look that up that song name on YouTube just yet if you're a first-timer, the most classic upload has an ***obnoxious*** spoiler in the visuals...)\n\n**Visual of the Day Album:**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/mqmXGuu\n\n**Theory of the Day:**\n\nAlright u/Star4ce, time to collect your first instance of an award you have clearly been gunning for (good job!) courtesy of [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/v48x86/rewatch_higurashi_no_naku_koro_ni_discussion/ib4hn3o/):\n\n&gt;I'm more particular that another group of (non-supernatural) people have set up camp here and do some shady N.E.R.V.-kind of shit and all the ruckus of demons and ritual murders is both a cover and method for silencing people coming too close to the truth. Cloning? Human experimentation on mind transfer/control? Creating life? Another set of psychopaths trying to summon an actual demon or driving them out?\n\n**Analysis of the Day:**\n\nOkay, so we have two worthy winners today and I can't choose so it's going to be a draw!\n\nFirst, there's u/Nazenn with [these thoughts on the show's execution](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/v48x86/rewatch_higurashi_no_naku_koro_ni_discussion/ib32wmj/):\n\n&gt;Rena freaks me the fuck out. Something about the way she always know what he's doing and the way the girls predator-selves have an almost reckless disregard for keeping up appearances when talking with him, it just gives me the feeling that their obsession with him is beyond their own control, and driven by something beyond just wanting him around because they said so. It creates this really strange almost double dynamic where every pairing of characters is on completely uncertain ground as to how they'll effect each other becuase of how quickly things can change. It leaves the show feeling unpredictable on a small scale but without the over-convenience or randomness that often bogs down shows with this sort of set up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The final scene with Keiichi feeling like Oyashiro-sama is behind him, the shadow stuck to his back, after being drugged once again has me questioning what the alt-girls really are, and how much of this is ties to psychology and culture over anything more explicitly surreal.\n\nAnd second there is u/EsquilaxM [giving the mystery the level of thought it deserves](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/v48x86/rewatch_higurashi_no_naku_koro_ni_discussion/ib3n722/):\n\n&gt;Major thing that's bugging me right now. Is why they only tore out part of the note...Or rather, why they chose those specific parts of the note to leave behind? Having him saying his life is in danger and blaming the girls makes sense if they're painting him as psychotic. But letting him inform the police of a van with 4 men doesn't make sense, because vehicles can be tracked...They can probably assume he's already told the police about the van that tried to run him over, so maybe they're trying to play off the van as part of the psychosis? (The drug/syringe is obviously the one bit of evidence that would cause the psychosis/supernatural theory to be damaged. So they're hoping the rest of the note will feed into the myth...They likely manipulated the other suicide note similarly? Though we've not seen it and it doesn't appear on TIPS)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Another thing that's coming to mind is the man at the door is obviously (or intentionally looks like) the local village doctor. So when the doctor gave him that superfluous shot, that could've been an opportunity to drug Keichi...But I can't think of anything that happened that day that would be suspicious. Of course it could be that he blacked out and we werne't shown it, but he blacked out straight away in this episode so seems unlikely (but not impossible so I guess keep it in mind?)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;(Another thing that's bugging me is that he couldn't fight off Mion and Rena when his legs were free, I figure he'd at least have enough strength to make it clear that he was being injected with something through the trauma sites, but then I guess the same thing happened with the photographer, though he had more assailants...I'm just gonna chalk this up to narrative convenience, but it makes the death feel a bit like a cop out)\n\nKeep 'em coming!\n\n**Question(s) of the Day:**\n\n1) [What is your](https://v.animethemes.moe/Chihayafuru-OP1.webm)... excuse me, what is your favorite game?\n\n2) [Do you](https://v.animethemes.moe/RozenMaiden-OP1.webm)... excuse me, do you like dolls?\n\n##**Next Episode Preview:**\n\nOkay, so: Season 1's next episode previews are in the form of a short, strange poem (whose formatting is borrowed from the VNs).  They are not spoilers.  (Kai's can be another matter, but we'll get there when we get there.)  However, my subs often translate the text on the screen... which are, in fact, lines out of context from the next episode.  \n\nSo, for anyone who really doesn't want to take a risk, here is the poem:\n\n\"What I want to see is the shape in the dark.  \nWhat I want to hear are the hesitating footfalls.  \nWhat I want to know is where I really belong.\"",

suicide note similarly though weve not seen it and it doesnt appear on tips\ngt\ngt\ngt\ngtanother thing thats coming to mind is the man at the door is obviously or intentionally looks like the local village doctor so when the doctor gave him that superfluous shot that couldve been an opportunity to drug keichibut i cant think of anything that happened that day that would be suspicious of course it could be that he blacked out and we wernet shown it but he blacked out straight away in this episode so seems unlikely but not impossible so i guess keep it in mind\ngt\ngt\ngt\ngtanother thing thats bugging me is that he couldnt fight off mion and rena when his legs were free i figure hed at least have enough strength to make it clear that he was being injected with something through the trauma sites but then i guess the same thing happened with the photographer though he had more assailantsim just gonna chalk this up to narrative convenience but it makes the death feel a bit like a cop out\n\nkeep em coming\n\nquestions of the day\n\n1 what is yourisURL excuse me what is your favorite game\n\n2 do youisURL excuse me do you like dolls\n\nnext episode preview\n\nokay so season 1s next episode previews are in the form of a short strange poem whose formatting is borrowed from the vns  they are not spoilers  kais can be another matter but well get there when we get there  however my subs often translate the text on the screen which are in fact lines out of context from the next episode  \n\nso for anyone who really doesnt want to take a risk here is the poem\n\nwhat i want to see is the shape in the dark  \nwhat i want to hear are the hesitating footfalls  \nwhat i want to know is where i really belong"

        "Ultimately Sakura and Sasuke never really had any room to develop as a pairing, for many reasons...\n\nOne Sided: For anyone that's watched the show, this is pretty clear and needs little explanation. Part 1 was Sasuke and Sakura with two polar opposite ambitions. Overall it was mostly Sakura trying to get Sasuke's attention while Sasuke would give her the cold shoulder. Shippuden was even worse...\n\nSasuke going rogue: By this point during the plot, Sakura hasn't seen Sasuke in years. While Sasuke is meanwhile in ties with someone who plans on destroying the leaf. There's not much reason why she's still harboring \"romantic\" feelings by this point.\n\nSasuke turning evil: By this point... it's beyond reasoning how someone can attempt to kill someone twice, make it clear he wants to destroy a village that harbors many friends and family of that said person... only for the person to still \"love\" him.\n\nNo Screentime: Overall with Sasuke going rogue and on the other side, there was simply no area where Sakura and Sasuke could have built chemistry for a grand majority of shippuden.\n\nDerailed Sakura's character: Sakura spent half of her character development rationalizing her undying \"love\" for Sasuke. She started off well in Shippuden working to make herself of aid to Naruto... but that quickly nosedived ever since the Itachi pursuit arc. Overall many wierd and dumb decisions by her, especially in the Kage Summit arc. And even insanely was stuck on Sasuke's feelings... while they were fighting MADARA.\n\nIn the case of Naruto and Sakura however...\n\nMore potential development: The amount of screentime Naruto and Sakura shared throughout Part 1 and shippuden was immense. There was more than enough opportunites to squeeze some potential development, especially for the first half in shippuden.\n\nChemistry: Sakura had become a lot more caring towards Naruto as Part 1 came along. It's relatively clear the amount of care Naruto has harbored towards Sakura since the beggining of the series. By Shippuden, the amount of care the two had for each other had became equal. Throughout the plot, the two have had rather friendly back and forths that were rather harmless. Sakura found herself motivating to become stronger because of Naruto, and she on the other hand helps Naruto mature and grow as a character along the way. At the end of the day they were teammates in Part 1 and Shippuden who both made each other better.\n\nBoruto: For any Boruto fans... Naruto and Sakura being together wouldn't change much of the plot in my opinion. Boruto doesn't harbor any hyuga abilities, and would get carried by karma regardless. How he gets his jougan isn't confirmed, but you could write in some alternative reasoning on him getting it besides bloodline. Sarada wouldn't change much either, especially personality wise where she has no reason to change. Although her \"super strength\" fighting style similar to Sakura's wouldn't be there, say her mom is Karin, the extra chakra from that bloodline makes her much more stronger in the show. And considering the power-scaling in Boruto, it definitely would make more sense.\n\nLet me know what you guys think though. Obviously not every MC and female lead need to be together, but in Naruto's case, especially with the pairings at the end of the series... most of them weren't really developed well.",

        "One of the things I love most about this show is that it feels like there's hardly ever any filler.  Like every episode or scene even makes the most of it's time and portrays moments either directly tied to or relevant to the overall plot.

        "First of all, I am not a fluent English-speaker, therefore there may be mistakes and a lack of vocabulary. This is also my first review [here](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ki11grave/reviews). Secondly, if in order to explain plot holes, you need to come up with theories, then it\u2019s not an explanation. You can\u2019t solve a math problem by adding an extra variable. I am against it also, because it will definitely lead into fans being smarter than creators and fans wrongly thinking that creators are genius. And lastly, I don\u2019t need to watch Steins;Gate 0 or play a VN in order to understand what is going on. Steins;Gate the anime is a self-contained project that is considered to be a masterpiece. It doesn\u2019t need DLCs. And if SG0 explains something, I\u2019m sure it also adds even more plot holes.\n\nSo, I think there are 2 ways of time travelling that make common sense: either it is impossible to change past at all (travelling is a part of Fate\u2019s plan) or an alternative timeline is created where Grandfather Paradox doesn\u2019t exist and where there may be two versions of one person (a time traveler and not). In other words, either Fate exists and you can\u2019t defeat it or it doesn\u2019t exist at all! Any other fictional rule of travelling will lead to questions.\n\nThis show tries to unite these two ways. You can\u2019t change the past but if you change something drastically, then Fate is like: \u201cYo, I didn\u2019t sign up for this! I\u2019m out.\u201d. If you already don\u2019t smell some bullshit, then I don\u2019t know how else to explain to you that there are some. Anyway, heroes didn\u2019t win the lottery and they are still friends with Faris after her d-mail, so this system works pretty well until it suddenly does not.\n\nSomehow, Faris\u2019 dad is less important than Mayuri. And this guy changed the whole city\u2019s infrastructure! I think that Okabe would still start a resistance against SERN even if Mayuri\u2019s alive. And it doesn\u2019t even have to be SERN who will kill Mayuri! So, why is her death so important!? And what\u2019s with that nonsense car chase scene (episode 21)? Why was the driver doing this? Where did they go after killing the girl? Am I watching Final Destination?\n\nAlso, why Mayuri\u2019s death\u2019s date is always postponed 24 hours later? If an explanation is that it\u2019s a timeline who tells protagonist that he is doing everything right, then \\*\\*\\*\\* this explanation. This means that Fate is too kind. And why did SERN tried to capture heroes one day later also? From their perspective nothing changed (heroes know too much and they built time machine). Why wait one day?\n\nAnother main question is what do SERN, Mr. Braun and Moeka know? And since when they start knowing? Well, they know that heroes were thinking of promulgation, so it must be Braun who heard about it through the window and he told about it to superiors. So SERN already knows about heroes, either because of Braun, or because of a secret database where a first d-mail is located or because they hacked Daru\u2019s PC. Damn, they even launched an operation in order to capture them. So how, please tell me how deleting information from their database days later will change the timeline since SERN already knows that heroes have built a time machine!?!? And why later in a show they aren\u2019t doing anything! They are just letting Okabe doing his timey-whimey stuff!\n\nIt seems that Moeka knows that SERN wants to build a time machine? Why does a pawn know that? Her only goal was to find IBN, she does not need to know about SERN\u2019s secrets! Why did Okabe tell her everything after she mentioned FB (episode 6)? Why did Moeka visit the lab after Luka\u2019s d-mail (episode 9)? Is this because of despair, because she hadn\u2019t found IBN in a shrine (this is what I call \u201cadding an extra variable\u201d)?\n\nNow, in second episode Makise proved that time-travel is impossible. We don\u2019t actually see the discussion in class, just a board with pseudo-science stuff on it, but her statement proved to be right, because in the beginning heroes don\u2019t travel through time. They send their memories through it. But then Amane shows up and boom: physical time travel! I thought that it was one of important world-building rules. Makise proved that it is even theoretically impossible, but no, she was just wrong. And why did Amane forgot everything after travelling to 1975 and remembered everything only and only 11 years before 2010 (episode 16)? Is this because of year 2000 problem (adding variables again)?\n\nAnd why, why exactly does Okabe remember everything? I find it interesting that after building Time Leap Machine our special protagonist is not that special anymore. Why was SERN sending threats? Why was time stopping during Mayuri\u2019s deaths? There was no foreshadowing that Braun is FB, while there were a lot in Amane and Moeka\u2019s cases. In twenty third episode there was a talking about a time paradox. Time paradox!? Damn, I hate when time travel stories tell that people are able to mess with time how they want, but meeting yourself is a huge \u201cno\u201d, somehow.\n\nNow the most ridiculous thing: superstitions actually work in this anime! Right, Luka could change their gender with a help of superstitions! That\u2019s it. I\u2019m done! Steins;Gate lost all my respect as a serious, complex sci-fi project.\n\nWell, no, when a series does something good, it does it good. For example, in first version of alpha timeline Amane didn\u2019t exist. She couldn\u2019t save heroes from SERN, they got captured and now we got a dark future. Amane was born, she travelled to past, saved heroes in thirteenth episode and we got a second version of alpha timeline where SERN is doing nothing to stop Okabe (they could steal the machine while he was not home or idk) and he successfully destroys this timeline. Now look, without future-Okabe\u2019s scream, past-Okabe wouldn\u2019t have noticed Makise\u2019s corpse and wouldn\u2019t have sent his first d-mail. He would just go home and wait for WW3. Then Amane is born, she goes to past and forces protagonist to save Makise, because he is her uncle. But there is no Operation Skuld, therefore he fails, screams and that\u2019s when past-Okabe finds out the corpse, goes to alpha timeline, wins because of everything I described earlier and creates Operation Skuld. How do you like it? Well, actually it\u2019s just one huge variable and we just see a Bootstrap Paradox without a beginning. Now let\u2019s find out why in RadioKaikan there are only two Okabes, and not three.\n\nWhat do I think of Steins;Gate as a whole? It\u2019s OK. I always liked psychological thrillers and time travel stories. And a psychological thriller part is well-done. The atmosphere and color correction is great, the dynamic between heroes and jokes are good. If only plot and its holes weren\u2019t bugging me that much. I watched SG first time 6 years earlier, because I was trying to find a great time travel project. Dark didn\u2019t exist that time, so I watched SG and I remember not liking it much. I expected to see a well-thought, complex series and I didn't get it. When I created my anime list, I gave it 6 based on my feelings. And now, after rewatching, it\u2019s still 6. Seriously, guys, if you want to see a good piece of media about time travel, go watch Dark or play Quantum Break. It just saddens me that many people praise SG and say that it\u2019s perfect, while actually it\u2019s the most overrated anime ever. I believe you can prove me wrong in one thing or two, but I think there are too many wrongs with this show. If you will somehow manage to explain everything to me, I will only be glad and will apologize.",

        "first of all i am not a fluent englishspeaker therefore there may be mistakes and a lack of vocabulary this is also my first review hereisURL secondly if in order to explain plot holes you need to come up with theories then its not an explanation you cant solve a math problem by adding an extra variable i am against it also because it will definitely lead into fans being smarter than creators and fans wrongly thinking that creators are genius and lastly i dont need to watch steinsgate 0 or play a vn in order to understand what is going on steinsgate the anime is a selfcontained project that is considered to be a masterpiece it doesnt need dlcs and if sg0 explains something im sure it also adds even more plot holes\n\nso i think there are 2 ways of time travelling that make common sense either it is impossible to change past at all travelling is a part of fates plan or an alternative timeline is created where grandfather paradox doesnt exist and where there may be two versions of one person a time traveler and not in other words either fate exists and you cant defeat it or it doesnt exist at all any other fictional rule of travelling will lead to questions\n\nthis show tries to unite these two ways you cant change the past but if you change something drastically then fate is like yo i didnt sign up for this im out if you already dont smell some bullshit then i dont know how else to explain to you that there are some anyway heroes didnt win the lottery and they are still friends with faris after her dmail so this system works pretty well until it suddenly does not\n\nsomehow faris dad is less important than mayuri and this guy changed the whole citys infrastructure i think that okabe would still start a resistance against sern even if mayuris alive and it doesnt even have to be sern who will kill mayuri so why is her death so important and whats with that nonsense car chase scene episode 21 why was the driver doing this where did they go after killing the girl am i watching final destination\n\nalso why mayuris deaths date is always postponed 24 hours later if an explanation is that its a timeline who tells protagonist that he is doing everything right then  this explanation this means that fate is too kind and why did sern tried to capture heroes one day later also from their perspective nothing changed heroes know too much and they built time machine why wait one day\n\nanother main question is what do sern mr braun and moeka know and since when they start knowing well they know that heroes were thinking of promulgation so

knows that sern wants to build a time machine why does a pawn know that her only goal was to find ibn she does not need to know about serns secrets why did okabe tell her everything after she mentioned fb episode 6 why did moeka visit the lab after lukas dmail episode 9 is this because of despair because she hadnt found ibn in a shrine this is what i call adding an extra variable\n\nnow in second episode makise proved that timetravel is impossible we dont actually see the discussion in class just a board with pseudoscience stuff on it but her statement proved to be right because in the

The main protagonist is a male who didn't think he had any powers (if I remember right lol sorry it was a few years ago and ive watched so many since then.) He meets a group of people who help him out (I remember one is obsessed with some food or drink.) They eventually go to overthrow the government and are fighting a gauntlet of people and than the main protagonists sister joins in on the governments side (not willingly). They eventually free her than go on to over throw the government I believe.

I've looked through a bunch of list but could not find it. \n\nI don't remember much, and I'm afraid I might confuse with other things I've wached, but here is what I remember, which is very little things : \n\n\\- A young highschooler is paired up with a young lady (same school). I believe the guy has some kind of bad reputation : being weak or lazy. By paired up I don't remember why, I think he is supposed to protect her. At the beginning they are not pleased by the sitation but I believe they develop some romantic feelings between them.\n\n\\- It's not on the tragic side. There are often comical elements\n\n\\- the most unique thing I remember is that the MC and the antagonist fight each other in the air (not falling or flying : more like in a dirigeble if I recall correctly). That was the last episode I watched, I believe it was the end of anime or the first season of that anime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's vague. Even if you don't know any recommandation is welcome.

He is a nice guy who risks his life for anyone, whether it be his friends, family, or someone he doesn't even know well. The anger that he sometimes shows merely comes from his rivalry with Bakugo.\nDeku does have a sensitive side, and I think that is why a lot of fans make fun of him. But to be honest, he most likely will mature. Not all anime characters start out perfect, you know.\nSo, yeah, I really don't understand why some people hate him.

        "Me and my crew are seeking voluntary artists with experience in Writing and Illustration to develop a story called Bloom/Saku.\n\n**BASIC STORY:**\n\nIt is a story set about 2000 years from now. It is about a young man, named Jion, who lives in a world where technology is striving to replace organic life with machines. Humans have been divided into different clans, who only share one thing in common which is a cult-like worship of a flower that was produced by mother nature in order to fight the machines. The flower increases their core sense allowing them to rebel against the machines. When Jion was 14 years old one of the clans attacked his village and killed his sister. This clan has taken partial control of machines and used technology against all their defenses. His family is killed and after his sister is killed in front of him he starts going insane throughout the story. He has a special connection to the miracle flower. The clan who raided his town had heard a rumor of someone who had this connection and lived in his village, which is why they raided it. He joins the military and is selected to be injected with the serum produced from the miracle flower. It is not long after this that he starts noticing the powers that hide behind his bloodline. \n\n**\\*POSITIONS:\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Character designer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Page Illustrator\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Writer's assistant / Storyboard artist\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Environment Artist  \n\n\n**\\*\\*REQUIREMENTS:\\*\\***\n\n\\- Must be 16+\n\n\\- Must have experience in the desired position\n\n\\- Must be willing to work and participate with crew members.\n\nApplications will be filed here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSer\\_fCSuldFWuxIM\\_wbyraX2R1DsrdK3Uyy8MWRjrij5WlX5Q/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSer_fCSuldFWuxIM_wbyraX2R1DsrdK3Uyy8MWRjrij5WlX5Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)  \n\n\nThank you for your interest.

        "I was scrolling through Netflix and chanced upon Moriarty the Patriot and after reading the synopsis I decided to watch the anime and I was not disappointed. The mystery, the character development and drama was all well done and I enjoyed it. Shortly after I watched death note, again intrigued by the concept. After watching I couldn't help but notice a similarity between the MCs. \n\nBoth were on a mission to create a \"new world\". Both were out on a noble cause. William wanted to expose the vices of the nobility and take down the rich. Light wanted to do the same but he was just targeting criminals instead of rich people. This could be due to the different time periods both anime take place in. Nevertheless both MCs used crime and death to eradicate a certain group of people to purify the world. They also used different aliases to hide their true identities: William being known as 'Lord of Crime' ~~although it was more than one person~~  and Light being 'Kira'. Both were also highly intelligent. The smart plans and plot twists was what I liked about both shows.\n\nI would also like  to point out the similarities between the relationships between the MCs and their antagonists. Sherlock was wound up investigating the crimes orchestrated by William and William had him dancing at the tip of his palm (\"*Catch me if you can Mr Sherlock Holmes\")*. What I really liked between them was that they could anticipate each other moves...there was some telepathic connection between the 2 of them. The bromance was made the ending so emotional and satisfying. Whereas, between Light and L, there was mind games going on between them. L would anticipate Kira's moves and  Kira would plan his moves according to what L might do. It was a battle of wits. At one point in time, L even confesses to Light that he was his first true friend. I also really liked the scene  when L offered to wash Light's feet during his final moments. There was some divine symbolism and showed their relationship. However, there was no bad blood between William and Sherlock but Light remained focused on his goal to eliminate L till the end. \n\nThe biggest difference lies in how the two were portrayed. William was presented as a villain to the public but a hero to the audience. He had the support of his brothers and friends to carry out the crimes and achieve their goals. His cause was presented as noble, especially given his childhood, so the crimes that he committed, no matter how heinous, were justified. Whereas Light's objectives were seen as childish and malicious. Although he was wary of using the death note when he first got it, after killing a criminal to test out the note, he formed his mission to transform the world. In my opinion, the turning point was when Light managed to pull off killing Raye Penber, *making* Penber kill all the FBI agents as well as *making* Naomi kill herself. This entire act made him more confident in using the death note and as a result his hunger for power grew. That was when he strayed away from his goal and jut mercilessly killed anyone for his own benefit, on the whole waging a war with L. Some might argue that Light did change the world as the crime rates decreased and wars were avoided, saving more lives than killed (according to sources I've read). But this is not really made clear In the show and Light was still portrayed as a villain till his last breath. The important thing here is that William did not stray away from his targets and left innocent people unharmed. \n\nThe interesting thing here is also that the Lord of Crime did not have any supporters and was constantly being chased by the police and feared by the public. Even though he was the one who solved the country's inequality issue. Whereas Kira had a large fan following and basically created a cult. Considering the time period where both animes were set in, it shows the impact social media and the internet has in propagating such activities. The radio was a key player in the Kira case (eg. broadcasting the exchanges between both Kira's, luring Higuchi to the studio). In fact, if criminals' names and faces were not broadcasted to the public, Kira would have no one to kill.  I wonder if William had the death note, would have done things differently?  Or would he not pick it up at all?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post but these were some observations I made watching both shows b2b and I had to put them into words. Both shows  were certainly engaging and had me at the edge of my seat. Would love to hear all of your thoughts :D",

The anime start is rough but think about what it leaves out in the open at the start. rewatch and you see that the anime is litterally screaming foreshadowing so early i love it. Some people say that the characters dont have development. Of course you aint gonna notice it that much characters just dont change overnight it slowly happens over time. Another one i found is that there is no main villain, like A: you dont need an anime with a big villain and B: the anime doesnt really have one. You can somewhat understand most of the characters(except the creepy doctor hes just fuckin weird, but its shown decently well enough). Like am i just dumb or is just weird.",
